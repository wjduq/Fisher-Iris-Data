# K Nearest Neighbors Applied to Fisher Iris Data Classification

**Date:** 1/26/2023

By: Will Duquette

This analysis is conducted on the Fisher Iris Data set. The algorithm used is the K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. The machine learning code in this notebook is written from scratch (no built-in functions or packages), including the K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. It is best to run in Google Colab. The overall goal of this problem was to find the optimal value of k neighbors for our prediction purposes.

## Running Notebook

Running the notebook in Google Colab is simple. Select runtime from the menu at the top of the page, and choose "run all."
